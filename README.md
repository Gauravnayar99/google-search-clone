# google-search-clone
Google Clone is a search engine script that allows you to create your own search engine. It's a fully functional replica of Google's main page, and you can use it for searches and everything else. Google Clone performs searches over various verticals like Web, Images, Videos, Maps, News and Apps. Amazing project in my experience.
